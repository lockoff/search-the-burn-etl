It reminded them of home.\r\n\r\nSoul Brunch isn't just a party; it's like the backyard barbecues of home. It's like the cookouts of yesteryear. As your families invited your communities over, as the generations of soul families invited their communities over, so too does the Heroes & Super Villains family invite the Playa community over to eat together, drink together, get to know one another, dance with each other and uplift each other.\r\n\r\nFrom morning until nightfall, our trained chefs serve up the freshest breakfast burritos on the Playa, accompanied by professionally made craft cocktails. Our collection of international DJs spin smooth beats until nightfall.\r\n\r\nWe also give revelers a chance to clean up with our Soul Power Showers; guests experience the rebirth and rejuvenation of cool, cleansing water sprayed forcefully from our pressurized washer system (imagine a water saving car wash inside our shower areas for guests). Baptized anew, heroes set out on their way spreading positive vibes.\r\n\r\nDJ Lineup:\r\n-Marques Wyatt\r\n-Nicodemus\r\n-Deep Woods\r\n-Sabo\r\n-Rafael de la Cruz",

When you are holding onto your creative expression, your gifts, your particular genius, or pretending not to know what it is, it's gets very uncomfortable after a while. It will start itching inside of you to be created in physical form, it's deepest desire is to be born out of the dream space. You came to Planet Earth to share this, now is your time. Calling all healers, conversation-starters, rebels, light-workers, and medicine women. This workshop is broken down into four magical sections. \r\n\r\n1) Connection. How relating to others is the number one function of your business or passion project. We begin the workshop with getting connected on the soul level to your fellow sisters.\r\n2) Reclaiming Your Unique Brilliance. Refining your message and creating something in the world that is unique, contributive, and that people will pay for. \r\n3) Healing Your Relationship With Money. Girl, if you want to start or expand your business, you've got to look at your drama and trauma with money. What would it be like if money flowed to you with ease? What would it be like if you could actually receive it? We will dive into this exploration together.\r\n4) Closing Ritual. Our closing ritual will include a beautiful ceremony to hold each others intentions and desires as we go create in the world. You will be let into a \"light-share\" experience.",

The tours are flexible so feel free to join us on playa if you see a bunch of bikes traveling in a pack, or drop out if you want. The tour starts promptly at the bike racks across from the ARTery (on the Esplanade). Note that there are also ART TOUR - Guided tour (search Playa Events), and self guided tours (paper copies) available at the ARTery. Most of the art on the playa is self-funded, so be sure to check out your favorite art projects on the Burning Man website now, and then help fund them or volunteer through their respective websites.

        "description": "Biodanza has been baring hearts since the 60's. Developed in S. America it is now a world wide phenomenon bringing joy, pleasure, balance, health and healing through music, dance and sincere interaction. Contact and caress are tools of our trade. We deal in deep human intimacy, through touch, eye contact, movement and body language. Not verbal communication. We feel each other, letting the mind and its ways take a back seat for a change. We enhance our senses, our instincts and our state of consciousness. We perceive and experience ourselves and others differently when we do this. More authentically. More naked. \r\nThe first hour is for interactive activation and expression, maybe getting a little wild together. The second half is for slowing down, relaxing, melting and harmoniously merging with one another, exercising the polarities of enhanced sense of self to oceanic experience.",

This is like the Museum of Burningman Bodies. Within each pod we each have 2-3 minutes to tell our museum visitors about our body. Depending on group vibe and any time left, viewers may ask questions of the exhibit, or  request something they would like to be uplifted upon. The next person presents. This workshop will be tested this coming week at a regional burn. I‚Äôve started something without structure before at a workshop intensive of 18 people.

The only response we give to each others' writing is \"thank you.\" \r\nWe will likely depart from the Midway around 3:50 after we get ourselves organized and sit down to \"write out the cobwebs.\" Participate for as long as you wish.

The squares will all have different quests written on them that need to be completed in a certain timeframe, or players have to go back to the previous square of the same color. There are some short cuts, wild pink squares, and black lose-a-turn squares. The winner makes it to the end of the colored path and gets loved up by the colorful game jesters. Yay, so much fun!",

        "description": "It has happened to us all.  You're having a great time, easy and happy, dancing through the weeds of your own small life, and suddenly -- a clown.  He's trying to be funny at you.  He's a burlesque.  Or a Bozo.  Or a body comedian.  You can't punch him because that would be wrong.  You can't cry because you're terrified.  And you can't laugh because the life has been sucked out of you.  So you push it down, deep inside.  Where the clown trauma festers in its own silent and pressurized tank of suppressed rage and fear.\r\n\r\nThese incidents have been seen with increasing frequency as clowning has infiltrated our community.  Clowns are easy.  Clowns are anonymous.  Clowns are everywhere.  And clowns are dangerous.  They are the death knell of participation culture, just as the deadbeats were the death knell of hippie culture.  They embody the cheap, the quick, and the easy, and they should not be allowed to take over.\r\n\r\nCome to our shaded bar and snack on our snacks with us.  Learn the story of clowns, past, present, and future.  Drink your health in a clown-free zone.  Crush the red nose of clown oppression.  And embed a new mantra into your soul: \r\n\r\nI will never be clowned again.",

The theme song from \"CHiPs\" and other old school, cop inspired tunes -- provides the soundtrack for our shenanigans.

The workshop begins with a ritual purification, connecting heart, body, mind, and spirit. Then it moves you into a deeper state of consciousness and closer to your individual and collective soul’s purpose. Utilizing dance, contemporary shamanism, hands on healing, drumming and global music, this powerful and beautiful soul work sheds inhibitions and heightens inner awareness in a safe and carefully monitored group setting. Dancers are blindfolded in the shamanic tradition and step beyond their conscious fears and limitations and allow their innermost creative sides to break free. Dancers tune in to sound and movement to take an inner journey exploring a trance-like state of self-discovery and self-realization.",

It's what pushes people to the point of insanity; that unexplainable quality that pulls people to the dark side. Some days, Dark Sparkle is your alter-ego; other days it is your most natural feeling form. Dark Sparkle is Mona Lisa's smile, biscuits and gravy, the Fonz, the apocalypse. It is an adventurous way of life--physically, emotionally and mentally that citizens of BRC embrace. Our shows are an opportunity for Dark Sparklers and other BRC citizens to explore and showcase their Dark Sparkle through performance, storytelling, and tease.

        "description": "My camp, the Free Photography Zone, has been doing portraits of the participants of Burning Man continuously for the past 19 years.  Each person, or group, is photographed in a studio setting and given an instant print as their tangible reminder of their Burning Man experience.  I then photograph then on medium format black and white film so that, if they wish, they can get prints at a later date.\r\n\r\nThese are not a re-do of your high school yearbook portrait just in Burning Man attire.  I try to give each person enough time to help me make a lasting photograph.  On our gallery walls in our shade structure there are black and white prints ranging in size from 16x20\" to 4x5' that I hope will be of some inspiration to you.  Though I try not to duplicate what I have done in the past they may serve as a jumping off point for our photography session.  Not the easiest thing given the approximately 47,000 black and white negatives done so far.  I have never counted and see no reason to start now.\r\n\r\nI consider the people I photograph as the most important part of any photograph and always try my best to make a photograph that will be of lasting value and interest well beyond the moment of its creation.\r\n\r\nCome, join me, and together we may make something wonderful.  \r\n\r\nI usually begin each day about 10 or 11 AM and continue into the night till I can't keep on my feet any longer.  Weather permitting I'll begin on Sunday August 30th through Saturday September 5th.\r\n\r\nI do look forward to photographing you.",

That’s right! It's baaaaaaack! How hot can you take it? Spicy, savory, and DEFINITELY alcoholic, join us for even more bacon, even bloodier marys, and some lovely bottoms for all to view (ask before you fondle!)! Bring your own cup to Camp GTFO (location TBD) for the best*, hottest*, and TASTIEST* bloody marys and goodies on the Playa! . (* dustiest; let's not kid ourselves.) There are usually other food goodies available, as we see fit and depending on how drunk we got the night before/that morning. We'll also have our famous Hydration Station for those who aren't drinking or for those under 21 (because they can all still eat BACON, right?! Shush, it's a rhetorical question.) . Also revisit the ARE YOU A BLOODY PUSSY OR WHAT? bar, and see how hot you can take it when Gemini pours whatever the hell she damn well feels like into a shot glass for you to drink. Want to earn YOUR red wings?! Have a seat in our living room, dance the morning away in Tiny Club, play on the trampoline (clothing optional, of course!), or write in the shared journal! Bring your ID, bring your friends, bring your family, and BRING YOUR OWN FREAKING CUP!",

Participants can come and list what they want or may have to gift. If a participant doesn't have something, we'll provide a gift of their choosing. Then using a trade-loop algorithm a web of exchanged items is created that pairs participants with gifts they want. No bartering or haggling occurs because the person giving the gift is almost never the person the receiver exchanges their item with. Everyone gets something they wanted, the only \"value\" created is completely subjective to the recipient. For those who only wish to give, we photograph them and give their item's recipient their photo/information to potentially interact with later. Those without anything to give can still participate and will always receive something in the exchange.",

The most interesting practice would be turning your thought toward him for a few minutes without speaking and enjoy drinking in this small silent space. I always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy.

Beer Pong is a possibility if our moop management plans pan out. Food will include your backyard staples- hotdogs, lamb skewers, corn on the cob, and various other items.\r\n\r\nThe bar will, of course, be open. We plan to have a keg to serve inexpensive beer (and also cut down on MOOP from cans.)\r\n\r\nGames Include:\r\n\r\nCornhole/Bag Toss\r\nLadder Golf\r\nHorseshoes\r\nDarts\r\nAsparagus Jousting\r\nCanjam",

Fire has been used to increase the yield of wild crafted harvests, hunting practices, and the control of watershed resources.

Silliness guaranteed!\r\n\r\nTuesday through Saturday from Noon until 5:00pm Black Rock City citizens can jump on the \"K\" (subway) Train with its outrageous ads and colorful graffiti to arrive at the platform of Koney Island’s best kostumery – the closed down mysterious K Station.  Kamp Karneys assist folks as they morph themselves with over TWO TONS of costumes. Exit through the gift shop onto the runway where burners strut their newfound finery rebirthed onto the playa - ready to participate with extra attitude. From the raised dance platform watch the daily fashion shows and ongoing esplanade carnival. Loved by the paparazzi and Cheered on by subway straphangers, live DJ music, and the infamous ring master MCs, citizens can show their freaky side on the runway under the watchful eye of the 25' tall King Kong. Hanging from the Empire State Building, even Kong gets his freakshow on with his Guinness World Record 45' pink tutu (Tutu Tuesday) and BRC Animal Control bling.",

Located along the fence, like a mirage looming in the distance, out of the desert, from the dust: Ice Cold Margaritas. The Last Bar on Earth, past the Esplanade, past the Man, past the Temple… as far as a person can go in Black Rock City.\r\n…or…\r\nThe First Bar on the Playa; depending on which way you are coming to the bar. For those trekking across the barren wasteland, evading the dozen or so security and law enforcement agencies, avoiding detection by radar and heat sensors, struggling to finally reach the perimeter fence; our Bar is there to offer you an ice cold beverage and welcome you Home with a hug, brother/sister, before contacting the proper authorities and turning you over to security.\r\n\r\nFor several years I have rode my bicycle with trailer out to the furthest point in Black Rock City with all the booze, juice, water, soda and ice I could fit in the 3 large ice-chests. I purposely set up at the remotest spot I can find, away from camps, sound systems, art vehicles and crowds.  Trying to provide a service to intrepid playa explorers, people out riding bikes along the trash fence, those reaching beyond the EDM to see the desert vastness. As they spot our stack of coolers along the fence, in they trickle and find Iced Cold Margaritas waiting for them. Every year we go through every drop of beverage we can carry out there, usually in under an hour or two. Hosted by Camp Threat.\r\n\r\nBring a cup and witty banter. Join us at the fence.\r\n\r\nAnd, YES, most definitely, Daft Punk will be playing.",

        "description": "Start your evenings with the most intense laughter you can experience. We laugh for no reason, other than for exercise, and health. Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through group laughter. It’s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits. Find much more info online by searching on Laughter Yoga, but come! Enjoy!",

There will be an exploration on the difference between the Indian Hinduism (Polytheistic) & Chinese Taoism (Monotheistic) theories and how we can integrate these two philosophies into our daily spiritual practice to empower ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe discussion will then be followed by a 2 hour Yoga & Qi Gong class which will blend together the elements of ancient India (Yoga) and China (Qi Gong) to provide a dynamic moving meditation focused on providing a balance of both Yang (active) and Yin (passive) elements, that will conclude with a healing Yoga Nidra (conscious deep sleep) meditation - leaving you empowered, focused, and energized - ready for the burn and the new year. \"",

Come for an early hour of low impact exercise in the Longevity Stick Art (LSA) discipline of 12 low-impact exercises to build balance, flexibility, strength, mental focus, breathing capacity, and vitality, and open your points and channels. Bring your water or hydration liquid. We’ll provide sticks for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese. He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain health through LSA, and vowed if he was ever freed, he’d dedicate his life to spread its benefits, with the proviso that no trainer could ever charge for it. (Like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, moved to Southern California, and taught classes of students and future teachers. Today, weekly classes abound in So Cal, around the US, and the world.

I have 18 years coaching authentic self-expression, including 4 TEDx talks. 22 years studying people / human interaction via songwriting (and expressing my findings artfully). 28 years as a performer in various capacities, especially singing. In my career I've presented music and talks for over 100,000 people. Also, I've spent the last full year doing a deep dive into femininity/polarity studies. I am an advocate for men being empowered (especially as women claim their power more and more), and attaining the capacity to leave legacies. This includes knowing how to navigate matters of the heart.

We'll sense and feel the way that energy moves through the body with Qi Gong practice. We'll explore somatic training and the Body/Mind practices of Developmental Movement and Experiential Anatomy. We'll investigate our relationship to form, space, and each other through Viewpoints Space Awareness and Mudra Space Awareness. \r\n\r\nThis class is a laboratory where we'll be working with the energy that animates our bodies. We'll be exploring how energy moves when the body moves and how mind can direct energy. We'll learn to harness the power of the breath and focus of the mind to attain higher performance outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe work is toward attaining a greater depth of expression of personal energy, achieving grace and ease in a variety of movement patterns, developing an equanimity of all body parts as initiators and supporters of movement in space, and gaining the ability to dance ecstatically with great amounts of energy without loss of awareness of where you are and what is around you. \r\n\r\nEveryone is welcome from dancers seeking to bring contemplation into their dance - to those wishing to bridge their sitting practice to their walking meditation practice to the rest of their active lives - to people who have never danced or meditated before.",

        "description": "Imagine, you’ve just met someone you’re highly attracted to. You’re having a wonderful conversation and you feel the excitement building in your chest.  You’re at the point where you know you want to take it to the next level. It’s the moment of no return. This moment of tension is both one of the hottest moments of attraction and potentially one of the most awkward.  \r\n\r\nHow do you know if the other person is at the same desire level? How do you assess their openness to touch, to a kiss, or more? A kiss or initial touch is relatively low stakes, but what happens when things heat up? What happens when you’ve just overstepped a line and can feel their withdrawal?  \r\n\r\nThese nuanced moments of initial sexual attraction can be the hottest of our lives. But we’re never really taught how to navigate highly sexually charged moments with someone completely new.  What does it mean to fully take responsibility for these moments so that when we’re done everyone involved feels totally awesome?   \r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will get a much deeper understanding of the nuances of initiating and negotiating hot and sexy connections. \r\n\r\n-Boost your sexual self-confidence\r\n-Know how to feel your “fuck yes!” and your “Oh no!” and everything in between.\r\n-Understand when and how to bring up \"the conversation\" so you don’t deflate all the sexual turn-on!\r\n-Gain clear sexy communication skills to keep it hot while still conveying important information.\r\n-And learn the number 1 reason why these skills will make you the sexiest person on earth!",

Programming varies but, with a library of terabytes of entertainment onhand, is bound to be... entertaining to someone.  Bring a friend!  Or two!  Maybe even three, but let's not overdo it, we usually don't have THAT much room.\r\n\r\nEveryone has to grow tired of nonstop raving now and again (I think... Do you?  Honestly, I wouldn't know... Never really was my thing...  Which is why I run a theater... in a desert..  Oh crap, I think I may have gotten off track...) so take a night off and JOIN US...\r\n\r\nFree intoxicants for the kids!  (No, not really... I'm actually just amazed at how many characters I'm allowed to type in this section...  Really.  I've only just passed the halfway point.  Isn't that nuts?  How are you to be expected to come up with so much to say, really...?)\r\n\r\nPrevious nights have included: Dude Night (Tron, The Fisher King, The Big Lebowski), Musical Night (Repo: The Musical, Tommy, Suck)... Some nights we don't even HAVE themes!  (Because, you know... Burning Man...  Plans vaporize!)\r\n\r\nSo be sure to visit us at some point in your travels.  You can also get yourself loaded at the Koi Lounge, and of course HAVE AN ABORTION... Or two... Or three! (You slut, but we don't do shame because.... What's the point?)",

By holding, rocking, and cradling each other, a direct path is formed to deep and visceral experiences of nurturance. Some of the movements we do induce mutual trance states by using repetitive circular motion. A hug that evolves into a spiral that is so safe and supported that we enter graceful states of consciousness. If you are looking for ways to enhance your relationship with your partner, this may be useful. Relating in non-verbal, non-linear fashion can have an effect of breaking through barriers of relating on new and different levels. People report that using these methods deepens and re-invigorates their relationship.",

We offer an outdoor play area, a covered open area, and new to our camp, an enclosed area offering privacy out of sight from passerbyers. We invite everyone but especially beginners and those curious about BDSM play to come and play in a safe, non-pressured, and supervised environment to learn and experience dungeon play. As our name implies (Playfully Yours), we focus on the lighter, more sensual, and playful side of BDSM. The dungeon is well equipped with 3 St Andrews Crosses, a seated cross, 2 benches, a kneeling spanking/flogging bench, a standing spanking/flogging bench, a suspension station, 2 padded saw horses, a standing/kneeling stock, an 8' chain spider web, and a petting cage. We offer several toys to come and experience and play with such as feathers, a variety of floggers, paddles, crops, pinwheels, fur gloves, and a violet wand. Our personnel are available to provide instruction and demonstration on the safe use of the equipment and will supervise all play. We also have a lounge area where you can relax and meet our campmates while checking out our camp. The lounge has a spanking bike, a corn hole bean bag game, lounge chairs, a mini bar serving our cherry bombs for those over 21 years old with id, as well as, a spinning wheel to facilitate participation.  There are also daily scheduled classes with demonstrations and audience participation. We'll have an Intro Into Dungeon Play and a Shibari Sexy Body Rope Tying classes. We also have gifting of collars, paddles and patches. Our hours accommodate those coming in an play both day and night, generally from noon to about 3 am.",

The default model for relationship in our society, monogamy, makes explicit the underlying belief that Freedom and Love exist in opposition with each other.\r\n\r\nBut what if our desire for Freedom in relationship is covering a deeper desire, namely that we want to know, and be assured, that we can speak and honor our deepest Truths, and Desires, even, and especially, while in we are in Loving committed partnerships. So what if, instead of talking about Freedom, we talked how to create a relationship where it's safe to speak our Truths, including all of our desires (even for others), and know that we will still be Loved?\r\n\r\nJoin us for a conversation about how open relationships can be created from a place deep Love and commitment to Truth.",

We then dispense our \"Tiki Punch\" (yes, it has a punch) well into the night. Nudity is never required but at Party Naked Tiki Bar it is rewarded. This year we have 1800+ hand painted commemorative leis to give to citizens that \"do it\" (get naked). Make sure to come by early and get lei'd. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Nude is not lewd so uninvited touching is prohibited. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day.

Or Neither. \r\n\r\nSeveral Riders PEDAL AND DRIVE head-to-head around a 60 x 90 foot track under the gorgeous CIRCUS TENT with LIGHTS, MUSIC and ANNOUNCERS! Our BUMPER CARTS are custom designed and one-of a kind! It's like driving your own personal pedal powered art car for 3 minutes or however long you last. The TENT is a SHADY OASIS in the DAY and a LIT-UP BEACON of fun at NIGHT!\r\n\r\n Winners of each race are determined by a mysterious mix of whatever the announcers at the time deem worthy. Is it the number of rear end or T-bone collisions you make happen? or maybe how many crashes you nimbly avoid with expert driving skills. Or maybe your winning attitude. Or your crazy costume. Maybe you cross the finish line first. Maybe you cross it last or not at all. You might still be a WINNER. We're betting on it! KIDS tall enough to pedal are welcome. Adults of ALL AGES brave or timid welcome. ALL Spectators welcome too! Come into the center ring and heckle your friends in the races!\r\n\r\nPEDALING is FUN but BUMPING is EVEN BETTER! Seriously, the bumpers keep you safe and you will laugh your ass off with every bump, crash, skid or pass. \r\n\r\nWe also welcome volunteers who want to help with PIT CREW duties! Wrangle the crowds, heckle the riders, keep the pedal carts repaired. Sign up for our newsletter on our FB page or just stop by anytime we are live on Playa!",

This is about sharing and listening to each other. We are all figuring this out and doing the best we can. Eugene & Mackenzie are as eager to talk about the challenges as they are to share in the joys.\r\n\r\nWe will have a little movement exercise to ground into presence in our bodies, as that is the best way to open to the true questions which reflect our heart's yearning and fears.\r\n\r\nThis will be a thoughtful, provocative and fun gathering. Let us learn from each other and in the end open to the possibility of more love, however it looks for us individually.",

Several Riders PEDAL AND DRIVE head-to-head around a 60 x 90 foot track under the gorgeous CIRCUS TENT with LIGHTS, MUSIC and ANNOUNCERS! Our BUMPER CARTS are custom designed and one-of a kind! It's like driving your own personal pedal powered art car for 3 minutes or however long you last. The TENT is a SHADY OASIS in the DAY and a LIT-UP BEACON of fun at NIGHT! Winners of each race are determined by a mysterious mix of whatever the announcers at the time deem worthy. Is it the number of rear end or T-bone collisions you make happen? or maybe how many crashes you nimbly avoid with expert driving skills. Or maybe your winning attitude. Or your crazy costume. Maybe you cross the finish line first. Maybe you cross it last or not at all. You might still be a WINNER. We're betting on it! KIDS tall enough to pedal are welcome. Adults of ALL AGES brave or timid welcome. ALL Spectators welcome too! Come into the center ring and heckle your friends in the races! PEDALING is FUN but BUMPING is EVEN BETTER! Seriously, the bumpers keep you safe and you will laugh your ass off with every bump, crash, skid or pass. We also welcome volunteers who want to help with PIT CREW duties! Wrangle the crowds, heckle the riders, keep the pedal carts repaired. Sign up for our newsletter on our FB page or just stop by anytime we are live on Playa! GUEST HOST CREWS SCHEDULED: GATE  CREW is Representing on Tuesday night. MYSTIKAL MISFITS are representing on Wednesday night!",

We begin with a deep dive into our truth—our true nature—which is simply a letting go and a knowing of who we always already are, beyond our ideas about ourselves and others: a simple direct undeniable knowing of our clear deep heart-mind-being. \r\nWe will ground ourselves in this present moment and connect with our higher self and cultivate our intentions, desires, and wishes for the night.\r\nUsing movement, stillness, and humor we bring awareness and acceptance to ourselves and our conditioning.\r\nThrough simple spontaneous body movements you embody and express your truth(s) and your true being. \r\nFinally we move into connecting and relating with each other while staying connected with our self. This process will be facilitated with some simple relating exercises and is a chance to see through our ego and conditioned habitual ways of relating and being. We invite a sense of humor to simply seeing ourselves and the conscious and unconscious games we play. \r\nBringing awareness to our patterns opens the possibility of playing with them and responding from our clear deep heart mind space, rather than reacting. Respond from awareness rather than react from habits. We live from our true nature rather than our conditioning. We dance.",

Ask about coming by and roasting your own on-the-Playa beans to bring back to the default world (a little Playa dust is the secret ingredient!), or help us gift coffee to the burners who serve our community.  \r\nIn the LNT (Leave No Trace) spirit, please remember to bring your own cup.

        "description": "\"What is Rootism?\" My response to this in short: Rootism is a belief that the truth of our learned existence lies in the Roots of all teachings/truths and beliefs. These truths are different for everyone based on how they we raised and what we resonate with at the time of our learning. As a Rootist, we take the roots of various truths and incorporate them into our own mantra, our own way of living, to become the well rounded person that we wish to be. When you resonate with more than one truth, you are a Rootist. There are many different types of Rootist's. You could be a Christian Rootist, a Buddhist Rootist, or any type of Rootist. The moment you resonate with more than one truth & take the roots of those teachings as your truths, you become a Rootist.\r\n\r\nRootism is a lesson that I have learned and come to resonate with over the last few years. I am grateful to share this information with each of you. Please feel free to share this with anyone with whom you feel might be interested.\r\n\r\nAs an offset of Rootism, we have The Rootist's Way. A style of yoga that is in-tentful in it's design and sequences to help to facilitate a certain type of energy clearing and calling in of new energies.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this and for wanting to know more about Rootism.\r\n\r\nThe 8 Principles of Rootism:\r\n\r\n∞Principles of Rootism™\r\n\r\n1.

It is sensitive to its surrounding and is vibrating in the same wavelength as the particles of niverse, as well as the life on earth. It lives in symbiosis with nature, mostly in flowers, becoming one with the Beauty All Around. The Butterfly symbolizes the Universal Spiritual knowledge and deep Wisdom, and creates its life in the perfect alignment of non-attachment, in a dance of flow and Ease. It has a life filled of transformation, from the day of birth until re-birth, between stages, outer and inner form, with ease and grace moving further, without attaching to its old shape, heart wide open for the life in front of Her. This Yogic Journey is dedicated for you to connect with YOUR inner Butterfly, through a travel of transformation, through your body and senses. Bring a Mat (if you have), soft clothing, yourself, as the beautiful and whole being you are.",

Really... \r\nAnswer the tiresome question \"How are you?\" in three (3) words that will say more, build immediate trust and help you to purge more friends on facebook than ever before! We all have the ability to 'know' more without using the left side of our brain. We just aren't so practiced. So, with a bit of science, a measure of technique, the willingness to try a 'different way' and a whole workshop of practice! we will be ready to immediately upgrade any relationship, including the one with the hottie you will meet tonight outside the Pleasure Dome!

We will bring something to identify the \"meat\" and identify Trustable Slut Members.\r\n\r\n# 1 rule of SWAP Meat is\r\nyou bring someone AWESOME\r\nto SWAP Meat.\r\n\r\nWe want to be introduced to more amazing people who want to meet fun, playful, and open women, who are in alignment with our values.\r\n\r\nBring someone who you would recommend to date your best friend. Bring someone who is \"available\" to date. Bring someone who has good boundaries and knows how to communicate. Bring someone who YOU are 100% okay with sharing.\r\n\r\nWho NOT to bring:\r\n-Some random person off the playa\r\n-Someone who is overly eager to hook-up (aka desperate).\r\n-Someone who isn't emotionally available or at least self-aware.\r\n\r\nOfficial Meat Policy:\r\n\r\n1) Meat can be of any gender.\r\n2) We encourage \"available\" meat. That word has many interpretations...it is whatever it means to you. However, here are some ways it means to us:\r\n+ is single or in an open relationship.\r\n+ their relationship agreements allow for dating.\r\n+ has time to date, meaning not just interested in hooking-up.\r\n+ has experience in our or some other community of sexy tribe.\r\n+ has emotional intelligence and communication skills.\r\n\r\n*NOTE: We are open to all gender orientations and sexual orientations.

The fear of expressing all our feelings diminishes, freeing us to make a genuine choices about how we act. Unspoken positive and negative feelings can create blocks in our relationships with friends, colleagues and loved ones.Through experiencing the AUM, relating becomes clearer, more honest and more fun. the AUM also allows you to reclaim to joy of simply being alive.Bring a pillow or cushion",

This often requires a willful transformation of ourselves — a creative shape-shifting — so that we see the world with new eyes, new senses, a new consciousness. It is only in this way that a new world reveals itself — as strange, yes, but perhaps also closer to world in which we dream.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, TEDx BlackRockCity will be an opportunity to open and reflect ourselves in new ways, to a new world, in which we are all transformed by ideas that matter.",

Learn how to use these powerful skills and movements to create a new and exciting level of intimacy that deepens the physical, spiritual, and emotional aspects of your sacred connection.  We will explore couple-hood as a yogic path to realization, letting go of the mind and surrendering to the heart through your lover. It is a practice of using your two-ness to realize oneness.  Yoga and Qigong are like brother and sister. \r\n\r\nBoth are esoteric, alchemical practices that were created for self-realization, with exercise being a secondary benefit. Qigong is much gentler than most forms of yoga, and a wonderful compliment to a vigorous yoga practice. Both practices have a common source, Neolithic shamanic practices, and both are ancient books of wisdom written in the language of the body. We'll physically explore the connection between these 2 books of wisdom within the context of your love relationship. We are channeling the sexual and creative energies of the body through visualization, movement, ritual, and breath, not sexual activity. Tantric Qigong is an intimate practice of being gentle with oneself and weaving one's own sexual energy, becoming truly receptive to one's own body dialogue.",

It’s time for us to tell a new story of femininity, with our choices, with our self-expression, and with our lives. There are too few positive examples of women who are in full command of their sexuality and its attractive powers. There are too few healthy stories of women who’s full creative expression is unbridled and uncontrolled.\r\n\r\nLearn how to harness the dual feminine forms and dual masculine forms of power in each of your interactions and become a true manifestor - brining your highest vision into reality through your being, your words, and your actions.You will learn an unforgettable map of your own sources of power, some of which have been lying dormant for your entire life. Once you can locate and allow all four faces of incorruptible power to move through you, you can lead, inspire, and serve almost anyone.

        "description": "LIke most carnival games, the risk is part of the fun.. This is a game with a simple premise; Draw a card from the deck and the player does what is written.  Is it ever really simple?  “The Game” requires a high degree of interactivity among all those involved, even those walking by may become drawn into the action and be participants. “The Game” has a tendency to create possibilities where there were once boundaries.  Choices where there were once obstacles.  “The Game”: the love child of truth or dare, charades, post office, twister, spin the bottle, and American's Got talent.. \r\n“The Game” is perfect for letting that INNER freak come out. Watch what happens when permission is given to the darker, more playful side of one's self. That part that stays just out of sight, watching from the sideline, wanting to take part, but doesn't due to social constraint or peer reprisal.\r\n“The Game” is both a game of chance and boundaries.  Winning is all a matter of perspective. Everyone wins with the upside of personal insight, everyone loses what may have been a self-limiting perspective.  A new episode with each draw is guaranteed to amaze and astound!",

A should is a 'could' with shame smuggled on top of it. Come explore shame and its cousins: guilt, envy, anger and jealousy. All these emotions have one thing in common, they usually hide their tracks and are hard to admit. Learn to transcend your shame with cutting edge subjective tools. We'll investigate the nature of shame & shaming, look at the adaptive advantages of them and how they serve & do not serve our development.\r\n\r\nJoin love coach Annie Lalla for some powerful exercises that will help you move beyond past shames and show you how desist from laying down new ones. This is a forum to discuss how to experience our emotions, especially the difficult ones, so they stop haunting your psyche.  You will leave shameless or at least shamelessly.",

Our team will have food and beverages for all,  please come and bring a friend to honor the loss of the bands tour manager Dennis Sheehan.  Drummer Larry Mullin JRs father passed away this year also.  Last year Bono had a bike wreck in NYC and sufferd many injurys and is unable to play the guitar on this years tour,  lead guitarist \"The Edge\" fell off the stage in Canada this year and was hurt also.  The burning of the art piece will lift the bad luck the band has had to endure and also honor the memories of those who have pass away.   We are going to produce a video of the event for the U2 nation to share in the event on youtube.  Thank you,  Viper.",

        "description": "Imagine, you’ve just met someone you’re highly attracted to. You’re having a wonderful conversation and you feel the excitement building in your chest.  You’re at the point where you know you want to take it to the next level. It’s the moment of no return. This moment of tension is both one of the hottest moments of attraction and potentially one of the most awkward.  \r\n\r\nHow do you know if the other person is at the same desire level? How do you assess their openness to touch, to a kiss, or more? A kiss or initial touch is relatively low stakes, but what happens when things heat up? What happens when you’ve just overstepped a line and can feel their withdrawal?  \r\n\r\nThese nuanced moments of initial sexual attraction can be the hottest of our lives. But we’re never really taught how to navigate highly sexually charged moments with someone completely new.  What does it mean to fully take responsibility for these moments so that when we’re done everyone involved feels totally awesome?   \r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will get a much deeper understanding of the nuances of initiating and negotiating hot and sexy connections. \r\n\r\n-Boost your sexual self-confidence\r\n-Know how to feel your “fuck yes!” and your “Oh no!” and everything in between.\r\n-Understand when and how to bring up \"the conversation\" so you don’t deflate all the sexual turn-on!\r\n-Gain clear sexy communication skills to keep it hot while still conveying important information.\r\n-And learn the number 1 reason why these skills will make you the sexiest person on earth!",

Vinyasa movements are smoothly flowing and almost dance-like, with synchronized breath and movements. Vinyasa has both mental and physical benefits. Physically, sweat expels toxins and re-energizes your body and can be an easy to challenging physical workout, mostly depending on you and where you take your practice. Mentally, the synchronized breathing relaxes your mind and helps to release any blockage of energy flow throughout your body.",

Are you over people asking why your body looks the way it does? Are you interested in creating real safe spaces for people whether they fit in the binary or not? Are you troubled by cultural appropriation on playa and the way some folks are treated as other or freaks in a way that doesn't feel good? Then this workshop is for you. This workshop is also for you if you want to delve into the intersections of race, gender, class and how these identities affect our experience at BM and beyond. Many of us come to playa to be free and our full liberated selves yet when we pass through the gate we have not dropped our baggage of racism, transphobia, sexism, abelism, and classism at the gate.  So let's be real and talk about how these isms affect our time on playa and off and what we want to do to create the world we want to live in. This workshop will be interactive, engaging, fun, and educational. Let's define what we want the word freakshow to me and let's reclaim ourselves and whole people who all deserve respect.",

Bring your favorite submissive of any gender but keep in mind this is a FEMDOM event, no male tops. Male switches must be in “sub mode.” Also, enjoy our Erotic Superhero Bar, including some very special explicit “shots.” Get certified as a cocksucker, or force some straight boys to suck strap-on!",

        "description": "The Zendo is a community outreach project at Burning Man that offers education and psychological support, with the goal to help reduce the potential harms involved in drug use. Volunteers provide peer-to-peer harm reduction support for individuals having a difficult drug-related experience and who don't require medical care. Guests are sometimes actively on substance, and other times are seeking integration support, or education about the risks involved in drug use. We staff the space 24/7 with trained mental health and medical professionals who provide oversight, as well as individuals experienced in crisis response.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to come to the training to learn more about volunteering, it will take place at Something Freaky This Way Foams, near 2:00&G, on Tuesday September 1 at 11AM. \r\n\r\nThe four principles of psychedelic harm reduction include: \r\n\r\n1. Create a safe space - If someone is having a challenging experience try to move them into a comfortable, warm, and calm environment. If possible, try to avoid noisy or crowded spaces. Ask what would make them most comfortable. Offer blankets and water. \r\n\r\n2. Sitting, not guiding - Be a calm presence of acceptance, compassion, and caring. Promote feelings of trust and security. Let the person's unfolding experience be the guide. Don't try to get ahead of their process. Explore distressing issues if they want, but know that simply being with the person is supportive and talking may not be helpful.\r\n\r\n3. Talk through, not down - Invite the person to explore what's happening and encourage them to try not to resist it. Remind them that they are safe. \r\n\r\n4. Difficult is not the same as bad - challenging experiences can wind up being our most valuable and lead to learning and growth. Help the person integrate the experience, and remind them the experience will continue to unfold.",
