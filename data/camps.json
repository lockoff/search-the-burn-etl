A Walk Through Time was initially exhibited in 1997 in the Bay Area and traversed one linear mile. It was a project 20 years in the making. Made anew for Burning Man 2015, the massive endeavor of exhibiting this new 1/4 mile A Walk Through Time is being undertaken to show Burners the reality of how long humans have been on this planet, and how quickly we have changed it in the last 100 years -- a mere nanosecond in the timeline of Earth's history. The intent behind brining this project to Burning Man is to make it one step in the process of ceasing climate change."

We value humor, communication, playfulness, open mindedness, and creating strong meaningful bonds between one another. On the Playa we gift hot miso soup, sake, and herbal aphrodisiacs, as well as engaging conversations with our guests. \r\n\r\nThere are camps at Burning Man that offer public spaces for sexual play and exploration. While we fully support those groups, we choose to instead explore sex positivism by creating a safe event space for healthy dialogue of human sexuality. Our mission is to share ideas and philosophies that aid in the discovery of our sexual selves. We have created, and are always improving, a dedicated workshop and event space that is a platform for our lifelong journey of learning."

Join us for snow cones, a chill place to relax and to find out what other fun things there are to do in the Gayborhood at our Concierge Desk every afternoon, Sunrise yoga most mornings, and our “Gypsy Mirrorball” event on Tuesday."

Turn it in to a wearable pendant at the craft table, and you’ll have an easier-than-a-bag-of-dust way to take the playa back to the default world."

Our response is that humans can discover their true nature through yoga and meditation. Self-discovery is a process of lighting up the mythic metaphor of the \"rainbow bridge.\" Anodea Judith writes that \"on our journey through life, the chakras are the wheels along this axis that take the vehicle of the Self along our evolutionary quest, across the Rainbow Bridge, to reclaim our divine nature once again...to restore the Rainbow Bridge is to reconnect to our own divinity, anchoring it in the world around us and healing the rifts that so plague our world.\"\r\n\r\nIn interacting with other burners, we would like to focus on 7 chakras over 7 days. We will offer a daily practice tied to each Chakra leading up to the lotus / crown / diamond chakra the day the man burns."

We took a lot of inspiration from the Book of Tea written in 1906 by Okakura Kakuzō of Japan in English, he addressed the growing concern of clash between the east and west cultures. The struggle he speaks of resonates with the modern cultural issues facing society, the very issues that Burning Man explores."

Feeling naughty? Have a cookie, but at a price (or pleasure). After all of this and you are still feeling blue then visit a Happy Spot. At the end of the day control light with your mind or sit in our sauna dome.\r\n\r\nIs your mind blown? No? Well aren’t you the adventurous soul.

The dancing & partying will be happening all the time as usual.  There will be nightly fire spinning, a night of fire baseball & a night of fire dodgeball.  Or just hang in the lounge watching the fire art and spinners.  As always the playground is fun for all ages."
